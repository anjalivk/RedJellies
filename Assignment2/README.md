# Exercise 2.1
**Idea project diagram**

Make a block diagram describing an embedded system youâ€™d like to have or make. Be imaginative. Reality does not apply here.

# Exercise 2.2
**Read mbed code, make diagram**

- Create a sign in and log into the mbed compiler
- Go to mbed platforms https://os.mbed.com/platforms/
- Select any platform (hint: search for a processor similar to the one you are considering for your final project)
- Read through the platform page
- Add to Mbed Compiler (button on right)
- Load a simple sounding template
- Create a block diagram for this program, briefly explain why you chose the platform and template you did, be prepared to talk about this board in Live Class

The SX1272 based NAMote72 platform is a LoRa end device solution with built in sensors including a GPS receiver, pressure transducer, touch sensor, accelerometer, and thermometer. The STM32L152RC is similar to the microcontroller that I was interested in for my project with the sensors that I wanted to use already interfaced as a ready to use system. 
The Serial Monitor control sends commands to radio and peripherals to perform specific tasks or to set specific parameters.
